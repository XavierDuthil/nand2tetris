# Nand2tetris
An implementation by Sebastien Duthil and Xavier Duthil of the Nand2tetris course (http://nand2tetris.org), which consists in virtually building a computer running a tetris game, starting only from a NAND logic gate.

# Modules
The course is divided into 12 modules, each representing a different layer of the final system:
  01: Boolean Logic
  02: Boolean Arithmetic
  03: Sequential Logic
  04: Machine Language
  05: Computer Architecture
  06: Assembler Project
  07: VM I: Stack Arithmetic
  08: VM II: Program Control
  09: High-Level Language
  10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
  11: Compiler II: Code Generation
  12: Operating System
