# Nand2tetris
An implementation by Sebastien Duthil and Xavier Duthil of the Nand2tetris course (http://nand2tetris.org), which consists in virtually building a computer running a tetris game, starting only from a NAND logic gate.  
Our implementations of the assembler, compiler and the other translators (VM to ASM and Jack to VM) are in the form of Python scripts.  

# Modules
The course is divided into 12 modules, each representing a different layer of the final system:  
*   01: Boolean Logic  
*   02: Boolean Arithmetic  
*   03: Sequential Logic  
*   04: Machine Language  
*   05: Computer Architecture  
*   06: Assembler Project  
*   07: VM I: Stack Arithmetic  
*   08: VM II: Program Control  
*   09: High-Level Language  
*   10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis  
*   11: Compiler II: Code Generation  
*   12: Operating System
